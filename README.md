## Tools - 
Jupyter notebook,
Python and its various libraries such as pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn,etc.

## 50 Startups ---
50 startup dataset conatins the data of 50 startups which has their spending on different departments anf the profit they have earned.
The main objective of this project is to build a regression model to predict the profit of a startup on the basis of its spending on R&D ,Administration  and Marketing.
In this case the profit might differ for every startup on their decision of spending or how much spending in a particular department in order to earn maximum profit.
The model build is about 92% accurate in predicting the profit of a startup given their spending in different department.

## Toyota Corolla ---
Toyota Corolla dataset ia huge with 1436 rows and 38 columns but we were specified the columns on which we need to build our model, which eventually reduced the complexity in building the model. The model id quite accurate anf fit which can predict the price of a model on the basis of the required entry and gives a 87% accuracy rate.
